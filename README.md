Quantifying spatial pattern similarity in multivariate analysis using functional anisotropy
==============
Overview 
--------------
This code will allow you to rerun the analysis described in the paper (HTML LINK). 

The basic structure is as follows: 
- Download data from open fMRI 
- Run preprocessing steps on the data 
- Run searchlight analysis 
- Run FuA analysis 

Below you will also see directions that will allows you run standalone versions of: 
- Tsd2008
- Tsd2013 
- The FuA calculation 

Getting the data set
--------------

Downloading the data and directory structure: 
- This code relies on the following data set from [Open-fMRI](https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000158/ "Data Used For Project"). Please download both Part1 and Part2 into "raw" folder (do not unzip).
- It also relies on the following directory structure:
