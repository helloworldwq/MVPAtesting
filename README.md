Quantifying spatial pattern similarity in multivariate analysis using functional anisotropy
==============
Overview 
--------------
This code will allow you to rerun the analysis described in the paper (HTML LINK). 

The basic structure is as follows: 
- Download data from open fMRI 
- Run preprocessing steps on the data 
- Run searchlight analysis 
- Run FuA analysis 

Below you will also see directions that will allows you run standalone versions of: 
- Tsd2008
- Tsd2013 
- The FuA calculation 

    pseudocode : 
    x = 1
